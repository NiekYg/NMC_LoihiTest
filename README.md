# Comparing Loihi 2 and GPU for Image Recognition with SNNs

This is the code accomanying the project "Comparing Loihi 2 and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for Image Recognition with Spiking Neural Networks" for the course "Neuromorphic computing".

The project aimed to compare GPU and Loihi 2 performance for image recognition with SNN based on the CIFAR-10-DVS dataset. 
Time, Space and Energy were to be evaluated. 

The gpu_implementation.ipynb contains the GPU implementation.
The files containing "loihi_implementation" in the file name contain different approaches to the implementation on Loihi 2, none of which were successful.
